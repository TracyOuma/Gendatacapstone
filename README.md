# Stroke Risk Analysis - Nigeria 🏥

## Problem Statement
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in Nigeria, contributing significantly to the country's cardiovascular disease burden. Despite being largely preventable through early identification and management of risk factors, stroke incidence continues to rise due to limited understanding of risk patterns across different population segments.

## Objectives
### Main Objective
To develop an interactive dashboard that analyzes and visualizes stroke risk factors in the Nigerian population, providing actionable insights for healthcare providers, policymakers, and public health practitioners.

### Specific objectives
1. Identify Medical Risk Factors
2. Examine Demographic Patterns in Stroke Incidence
3. Assess Geographic and Occupational Disparities
4. Evaluate Lifestyle and Social Determinants




## 🎯 What This Does

Visualizes key stroke risk factors including hypertension, heart disease, age, demographics, and lifestyle patterns to help understand what puts people at risk.


## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python & Pandas** - Data cleaning
- **Tableau Public** - Visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Analysis

## 📊 Key Insights

- Patients with both hypertension and heart disease show dramatically elevated stroke risk
- Clear age-related progression in stroke rates
- Significant urban-rural disparities
- Work type and marital status show interesting patterns
